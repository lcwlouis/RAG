She found her sister's book uninteresting because it lacked pictures or conversations.,"['Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”']"
What unusual sight prompted Alice to follow the White Rabbit?,"Alice noticed a White Rabbit with pink eyes take a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and hurry away, which sparked her curiosity and made her follow it down a rabbit-hole.","['when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.', 'but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.']"
What happened to Alice after she went down the rabbit-hole?,"After following the rabbit-hole, Alice found herself suddenly falling down a very deep well.","['The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.']"
What did Alice find and do with a jar while falling?,"While falling, Alice took down a jar labeled ""ORANGE MARMALADE"" from a shelf, but it was empty. She put it into a cupboard to avoid hitting anyone below.","['She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.']"
"How far did Alice think she had fallen, and what else did she ponder during her descent?","Alice estimated she had fallen four thousand miles, believing she was near the center of the earth. She also wondered about her latitude and longitude.","['“I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?”']"
Who is Dinah?,Dinah is Alice's cat.,"['“Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!” (Dinah was the cat.)']"
What did Alice land on at the end of her fall?,"Alice landed on a heap of sticks and dry leaves, which ended her fall.","['when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.']"
Where did Alice find herself after the fall?,"Alice found herself in a long, low hall lit by lamps hanging from the roof.","['she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.']"
What was the problem with the doors in the hall?,"All the doors in the hall were locked, preventing Alice from finding a way out.","['There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.']"
What did Alice find on the glass table?,Alice found a tiny golden key on a little three-legged table made of solid glass.,"['Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key']"
"Where did Alice find the small door, and did the key work?","Alice discovered a small door, about fifteen inches high, hidden behind a low curtain. The golden key fitted its lock.","['However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!']"
"What was behind the small door, and why couldn't Alice enter?","The small door led to a beautiful garden, but Alice was too large to fit through the passage, even her head.","['Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway']"
What was written on the label of the bottle Alice found?,"Alice found a bottle with a ""DRINK ME"" label on the table.","['this time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large letters.']"
What flavors did Alice taste in the bottle's contents?,"The drink had a mixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast.","['However, this bottle was not marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.']"
What was the effect of drinking from the bottle on Alice's size?,"After drinking from the bottle, Alice shrank to ten inches high, making her the right size to enter the garden.","['And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.']"
Why did Alice cry after shrinking?,"Alice realized she had forgotten the golden key and, being too small, couldn't reach it on the table. She tried to climb the slippery table leg but failed, leading her to cry.","['when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.']"
"What did Alice find under the table, and what was written on it?","Alice found a small cake marked ""EAT ME"" in currants, inside a glass box under the table.","['Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants.']"
What was the unexpected effect of eating the cake?,"Alice ate the cake expecting to change size, but she remained the same size, which surprised her.","['She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size']"
How tall did Alice become after eating the cake?,"Alice grew to be more than nine feet high, causing her head to hit the hall's roof.","['Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.']"
What was the result of Alice's crying spell?,"Alice cried so much that her tears formed a large pool, about four inches deep, that reached half down the hall.","['shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.']"

Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!”']"

How did Alice try to determine her identity by comparing herself to Ada and Mabel?,"Alice concluded she wasn't Ada because Ada had long ringlets, which Alice didn't. She also decided she wasn't Mabel because Mabel knew very little, while Alice knew many things.","['“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little!']"
Can you recite the poem Alice tried to remember about the crocodile?,"Alice recited a poem about a little crocodile that improves its shining tail, pours Nile waters on its scales, grins cheerfully, spreads its claws neatly, and welcomes little fishes with smiling jaws.","['“How doth the little crocodile\n    Improve his shining tail,\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\n    On every golden scale!\n\n“How cheerfully he seems to grin,\n    How neatly spread his claws,\nAnd welcome little fishes in\n    With gently smiling jaws!”']"
"What caused Alice to shrink again, and what did she do to stop it?","Alice discovered she was shrinking rapidly, down to about two feet high, and realized the fan she was holding was the cause. She dropped it just in time to stop shrinking completely.","['She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.']"
What did Alice realize about the water she was swimming in?,Alice realized she was swimming in the pool of tears she had cried when she was nine feet tall.,['she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.']
What creature did Alice encounter in the pool of tears?,"Alice initially thought the splashing creature was a walrus or hippopotamus, but then realized it was a mouse, similar to herself in size.","['Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.']"
"What French phrase did Alice say to the Mouse, and what was the Mouse's reaction?","Alice asked the mouse ""Où est ma chatte?"" (Where is my cat?), which caused the mouse to leap out of the water in fright.","['“Où est ma chatte?” which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.']"
How did the Mouse react to Alice mentioning cats?,"The Mouse reacted with a shrill, passionate voice, asking Alice if she would like cats if she were in its place.","['“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would you like cats if you were me?”']"
"How did Alice describe her cat Dinah, and what was the Mouse's reaction to this description?","Alice described Dinah as a dear, quiet cat that purrs by the fire, licks her paws, washes her face, is soft to nurse, and is excellent at catching mice. This description offended the Mouse, causing it to bristle.","['“I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended.']"
What did Alice say about dogs that offended the Mouse?,"Alice asked the Mouse if it liked dogs and then described a farmer's terrier that fetches, begs for dinner, and kills rats, which she said was worth a hundred pounds. This description offended the Mouse, causing it to swim away.","['“Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, “I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.']"
What animals and birds joined Alice and the Mouse in the pool?,"The pool became crowded with a Duck, a Dodo, a Lory, an Eaglet, and other curious creatures.","['It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.']"
What was the immediate concern of the group after getting out of the pool?,"The first question for the group was how to get dry, and Alice found herself talking familiarly with them.","['The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life.']"
How did the Mouse propose to dry everyone?,"The Mouse, acting as an authority figure, told everyone to sit down in a large ring, with itself in the middle, promising to make them dry.","['At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I’ll soon make you dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle.']"
What historical topic did the Mouse begin to speak about?,"The Mouse began to recite a historical account about William the Conqueror and the English, including Edwin and Morcar.","['“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria—’”']"
What solution did the Dodo propose for drying off?,The Dodo suggested a Caucus-race as the best way to get dry.,"['“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies—”', '“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”']"
Describe how the Caucus-race was conducted.,"The Dodo marked a circular race-course, and participants ran when they liked and stopped when they liked. The race ended when the Dodo called it over, after about half an hour, and everyone was dry.","['First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact shape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and away,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”']"
"Who won the Caucus-race, according to the Dodo?",The Dodo declared that everyone had won and everyone must receive prizes.,"['At last the Dodo said, “Everybody has won, and all must have prizes.”']"
What did Alice give as prizes for the Caucus-race?,"Alice gave out comfits from her pocket as prizes, with each participant receiving one.","['Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all round.']"
What prize did Alice receive?,"Alice's prize was a thimble, which the Dodo solemnly presented to her.","['“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.', 'Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.']"
"What did Alice ask the Mouse to explain, and how did the Mouse respond?","Alice asked the Mouse to tell its history and explain why it hated ""C and D"" (cats and dogs). The Mouse replied that its history was a long and sad tale.","['“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why it is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.', '“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.']"
Summarize the Mouse's 'long and sad tale'.,"The Mouse's tale was a poem about Fury prosecuting a mouse, with Fury declaring himself judge and jury, and condemning the mouse to death.","['“Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both go to law: I will prosecute you.—Come, I’ll take no denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’ ‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”']"
Why did the Mouse get angry with Alice during its story?,"The Mouse became angry because Alice was not paying attention to its story, and she mistakenly thought it was at the ""fifth bend"" of its tale.","['“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are you thinking of?”', '“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth bend, I think?”', '“I had not!” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.']"
"How did Alice describe Dinah to the Lory, and what was the reaction?","Alice described Dinah as her cat, excellent at catching mice, and mentioned that she would eat birds, which caused a sensation among the birds present.","['“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”', '“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the Lory.', 'Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: “Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you can’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”']"
What was the immediate consequence of Alice mentioning Dinah's eating habits?,"After Alice mentioned Dinah eats birds, the birds quickly left, with the Magpie citing the night-air and the Canary telling its children it was bedtime.","['Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in bed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.']"
What was the White Rabbit searching for when Alice saw him again?,The White Rabbit was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves he had dropped earlier.,"['It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves']"
"Who did the White Rabbit mistake Alice for, and what did he tell her to do?","The White Rabbit mistook Alice for his housemaid, Mary Ann, and ordered her to fetch his gloves and a fan.","['“Why, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.']"
Whose house did Alice find?,"Alice found a neat little house with a brass plate on the door engraved with the name ""W. RABBIT.""","['She came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it.']"
"What did Alice find in the Rabbit's house, and what did she do with the bottle?","Alice found the fan and gloves in a tidy little room. She also found a small bottle near the looking-glass, which she drank from despite it having no label.","['By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.']"
What happened to Alice after she drank from the second bottle?,"Alice grew so large that her head pressed against the ceiling, and she couldn't get out the door.","['before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t drunk quite so much!”']"
What extreme measures did Alice take when she grew too large for the room?,Alice put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney.,"['as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney']"
"Who called for Mary Ann, and how did Alice react?","The White Rabbit called for Mary Ann to fetch his gloves, and Alice, despite her enormous size, trembled with fear.","['“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!” Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.']"
What happened when the Rabbit tried to enter through the window?,"The Rabbit tried to enter through the window, but Alice's hand caused it to shriek, fall, and break glass, suggesting it landed in a cucumber-frame.","['Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll go round and get in at the window.”', 'She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.']"
What was Pat doing when the Rabbit called for him?,Pat was digging for apples.,"['“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And then a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!”']"
How did Pat describe what was in the window?,"Pat identified the object in the window as an arm, which the Rabbit found unbelievable due to its size.","['“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)', '“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!”']"
"What was Bill's task, and how did Alice interfere?","Bill was ordered to go down the chimney, and Alice, realizing it was him, kicked him as he scrambled down.","['“Here, Bill! the master says you’re to go down the chimney!”', 'She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.']"
How did Bill describe his experience in the chimney?,"Bill described being hit by something like a Jack-in-the-box, sending him up like a sky-rocket.","['“Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”']"
"What was the Rabbit's drastic suggestion, and how did Alice stop it?","The Rabbit suggested burning the house down, but Alice threatened to set Dinah on them, causing immediate silence.","['“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”', 'There was a dead silence instantly']"
"What was thrown at Alice through the window, and how did she react?","Pebbles were thrown at Alice through the window, hitting her face. She shouted for them to stop, which resulted in silence.","['a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that again!” which produced another dead silence.']"
"What did Alice observe about the pebbles, and what did she decide to do?","Alice noticed the pebbles turned into little cakes and decided to eat one, hoping it would make her smaller.","['Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make some change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.”']"
"What happened after Alice ate the cake, and what did she see outside the house?","Alice ate a cake, shrank, and ran out of the house, finding a crowd of animals and birds, including Bill the Lizard being held up by two guinea-pigs and given something from a bottle.","['So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.']"
What was Alice's two-part plan after escaping the house?,Alice's plan was to first return to her normal size and then find her way into the lovely garden.,"['“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.”']"
Describe Alice's encounter with the enormous puppy.,Alice encountered an enormous puppy with large round eyes. She tried to coax it but was terrified it might be hungry and eat her.,"['An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little thing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.']"
How did Alice interact with the puppy using a stick?,"Alice picked up a stick and offered it to the puppy, which delighted the puppy and made it rush at the stick. Alice then dodged behind a thistle to avoid being run over.","['Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over']"
"What did Alice find near her in the wood, and what did she decide to do with it?","Alice found a large mushroom, about her height, and decided to look on top of it.","['There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.']"
What creature did Alice find on top of the mushroom?,"Alice saw a large blue caterpillar sitting on top of the mushroom, smoking a long hookah with its arms folded, ignoring her.","['She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.']"
What was the Caterpillar's first question to Alice?,"The Caterpillar asked Alice, ""Who are you?""",['“Who are you?” said the Caterpillar.']
How did Alice respond to the Caterpillar's question about her identity?,"Alice replied that she hardly knew who she was at present, only who she was that morning, as she believed she had changed several times since then.","['Alice replied, rather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.”']"
What poem did the Caterpillar ask Alice to recite?,"The Caterpillar told Alice to repeat the poem ""You are old, Father William.""","['“Repeat, ‘You are old, Father William,’” said the Caterpillar.']"
"What is the content of the poem 'You are old, Father William'?","The poem describes a young man questioning Father William about his unusual actions, such as standing on his head, doing back-somersaults, eating a goose with bones and beak, and balancing an eel on his nose. Father William provides various explanations, often humorous or nonsensical, and eventually tells the young man to leave.","['“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,\n    “And your hair has become very white;\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head—\n    Do you think, at your age, it is right?”\n\n“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,\n    “I feared it might injure the brain;\nBut, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,\n    Why, I do it again and again.”\n\n“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,\n    And have grown most uncommonly fat;\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—\n    Pray, what is the reason of that?”\n\n“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\n    “I kept all my limbs very supple\nBy the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—\n    Allow me to sell you a couple?”\n\n“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak\n    For anything tougher than suet;\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—\n    Pray, how did you manage to do it?”\n\n“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,\n    And argued each case with my wife;\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\n    Has lasted the rest of my life.”\n\n“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose\n    That your eye was as steady as ever;\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—\n    What made you so awfully clever?”\n\n“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”\n    Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs!\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\n    Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”']"
What was the Caterpillar's critique of Alice's recitation?,"The Caterpillar stated that Alice's recitation was ""not said right"" and ""wrong from beginning to end,"" while Alice admitted some words were altered.","['“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.', '“Not quite right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the words have got altered.”', '“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar decidedly']"
"What did the Caterpillar ask Alice about her size, and what was her response?","The Caterpillar asked Alice what size she wanted to be. Alice initially said she wasn't particular but then expressed a desire to be a little larger, as three inches was a wretched height.","['“What size do you want to be?” it asked.', '“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one doesn’t like changing so often, you know.”', '“Well, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn’t mind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”']"
How tall was the Caterpillar?,The Caterpillar was exactly three inches high.,"['“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).']"
What advice did the Caterpillar give Alice about the mushroom?,"The Caterpillar told Alice that one side of the mushroom would make her grow taller, and the other side would make her grow shorter.","['“One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.”', '“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.']"
How did Alice use the mushroom to return to her normal height?,"Alice nibbled carefully at both sides of the mushroom, alternately growing taller and shorter, until she returned to her usual height.","['she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.']"
"What did Alice do when she saw a small house, and why?","Alice found a four-foot-high house and decided to shrink to nine inches before approaching it, fearing she would frighten the inhabitants at her current size.","['As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. “Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them this size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.']"
Describe the two footmen Alice observed at the house.,"Alice saw a Fish-Footman and a Frog-Footman, both in livery with powdered, curled hair.","['when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads.']"
What message was delivered by the Fish-Footman?,"The Fish-Footman delivered a large letter, an invitation from the Queen for the Duchess to play croquet, to the Frog-Footman.","['The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”']"
Why did the Footman say there was no use in knocking on the door?,"The Footman told Alice that knocking was useless because he was on the same side of the door as her, and the noise inside was too loud for anyone to hear.","['“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for two reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.”']"
Describe the scene inside the kitchen.,"The kitchen was filled with smoke, and the Duchess was nursing a baby on a three-legged stool while the cook stirred a large cauldron of soup over the fire.","['The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.']"
What was the problem with the soup and the air in the kitchen?,"The soup and the air in the kitchen contained too much pepper, causing the Duchess and the baby to sneeze and howl. Only the cook and a grinning cat on the hearth did not sneeze.","['“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing. There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.']"
Why did the Duchess say the cat grinned?,"The Duchess explained that it was a Cheshire cat, which is why it grinned.","['“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”']"
What did the cook start throwing in the kitchen?,"The cook began throwing fire-irons, saucepans, plates, and dishes at the Duchess and the baby.","['the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes.']"
"What was the Duchess's opinion on people minding their own business, and how did Alice respond?","The Duchess stated that if everyone minded their own business, the world would go round faster. Alice countered that this would not be an advantage, explaining that the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn on its axis.","['“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”', '“Which would not be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”']"
What did the Duchess say after Alice mentioned axes?,"The Duchess said, ""chop off her head!""","['“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”']"
What is the advice given in the lullaby the Duchess sang?,"The lullaby advises speaking roughly to a little boy and beating him when he sneezes, because he does it to annoy and tease.","['“Speak roughly to your little boy,\n    And beat him when he sneezes:\nHe only does it to annoy,\n    Because he knows it teases.”']"
What did the Duchess do with the baby before leaving the kitchen?,The Duchess flung the baby at Alice and then hurried out of the room to get ready to play croquet with the Queen.,"['“Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room.']"
How did the baby behave when Alice held it?,"The baby was snorting like a steam-engine and constantly doubling up and straightening out, making it difficult for Alice to hold.","['The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.']"
"What physical changes did Alice observe in the baby, leading to her realization?",Alice noticed the baby's nose was turning into a snout and its eyes were becoming very small. She then realized it had transformed into a pig.,"['There could be no doubt that it had a very turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all.', 'This time there could be no mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.']"
What did Alice think about the pig-baby after setting it down?,"Alice set the pig-baby down, feeling relieved as it trotted into the wood. She thought it would have been an ugly child but made a handsome pig.","['So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to herself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.”']"
Who did Alice encounter after the pig-baby left?,Alice was startled to see the Cheshire Cat sitting on a tree bough.,['when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.']
What was the Cheshire Cat's response when Alice asked which way to go?,The Cat said that the direction Alice should go depends on where she wants to get to.,"['“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.']"
"According to the Cheshire Cat, who lives in the two directions it pointed?","The Cat told Alice that a Hatter lived in one direction and a March Hare in the other, and that both were mad.","['“In that direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives a Hatter: and in that direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”']"
What did the Cat say about the madness of the inhabitants?,"The Cat claimed that everyone there, including itself and Alice, was mad.","['“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad.”']"
How did the Cheshire Cat explain its own madness?,"The Cat argued it was mad because, unlike dogs that growl when angry and wag their tails when pleased, it growled when pleased and wagged its tail when angry.","['“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. You grant that?”', '“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry, and wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now I growl when I’m pleased, and wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.”']"
What did the Cheshire Cat ask Alice about the baby?,"The Cat asked what became of the baby, and Alice replied that it turned into a pig.","['“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. “I’d nearly forgotten to ask.”', '“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.']"
How did the Cheshire Cat vanish this time?,"The Cat vanished slowly, starting with its tail and ending with its grin, which lingered after the rest of its body disappeared.","['this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.']"
What did Alice find most curious about the Cheshire Cat's vanishing act?,Alice found a grin without a cat to be the most curious thing she had ever seen.,"['“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”']"
How did Alice recognize the March Hare's house?,Alice identified the March Hare's house by its chimneys shaped like ears and a roof thatched with fur.,"['she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur.']"
"Who was at the tea party, and what were they doing with the Dormouse?","The March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at a table under a tree, using a sleeping Dormouse as a cushion.","['There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head.']"
"What did the March Hare offer Alice, and what was the reality?","The March Hare offered Alice wine, but there was none on the table, only tea.","['“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.', 'Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. “I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.', '“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.']"
What was the Hatter's first comment to Alice?,The Hatter's first remark to Alice was that her hair needed cutting.,"['“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.']"
What riddle did the Hatter pose?,"The Hatter asked, ""Why is a raven like a writing-desk?""",['“Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”']
What question did the Hatter ask Alice about the date?,"The Hatter asked Alice what day of the month it was, and she replied, ""The fourth.""","['The Hatter was the first to break the silence. “What day of the month is it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.', 'Alice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”']"
"What was the Hatter's complaint about his watch, and who did he blame?","The Hatter blamed the March Hare for putting butter in his watch with a bread-knife, causing crumbs to get in and making it two days wrong.","['“Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn’t suit the works!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.', '“It was the best butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.', '“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled: “you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”']"
How did the Hatter try to wake the Dormouse?,The Hatter poured hot tea on the Dormouse's nose to wake it up.,"['“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.']"
Did the Hatter or the March Hare know the answer to the riddle?,Neither the Hatter nor the March Hare knew the answer to the riddle.,"['“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.', '“Nor I,” said the March Hare.']"
How did the Hatter refer to 'Time'?,"The Hatter referred to Time as a person, saying ""It's him.""","['“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk about wasting it. It’s him.”']"
"When and where did the Hatter and Time quarrel, and what was the Hatter singing?","The Hatter and Time quarreled last March at a concert given by the Queen of Hearts, where the Hatter sang ""Twinkle, twinkle, little bat! How I wonder what you’re at!"".","['“We quarrelled last March—just before he went mad, you know—” (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) “—it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n\n‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\nHow I wonder what you’re at!’']"
What is the consequence of the Hatter's quarrel with Time?,"Since their quarrel, Time has refused to cooperate with the Hatter, making it perpetually six o'clock (tea-time).","['“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’t do a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.”']"
Why do they keep moving around the table at the tea party?,"Because it's always tea-time, they have no time to wash the tea-things, so they keep moving around the table as things get used up.","['“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time, and we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”', '“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.', '“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”']"
How did the March Hare and Hatter wake the Dormouse?,The March Hare and the Hatter pinched the Dormouse on both sides to wake it up and make it tell a story.,"['“Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried. “Wake up, Dormouse!” And they pinched it on both sides at once.']"
What was the beginning of the Dormouse's story?,"The Dormouse began a story about three little sisters named Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie, who lived at the bottom of a well.","['“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began in a great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well—”']"

"Why did the sisters live at the bottom of a well, according to the Dormouse?","The Dormouse explained that the sisters lived at the bottom of a ""treacle-well.""",['“It was a treacle-well.”']
"What were the three sisters learning to do, and what did they draw?",The Dormouse said the sisters were learning to draw and drew things that began with the letter 'M'.,"['“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew all manner of things—everything that begins with an M—”']"
"Why did they move places at the tea party, and how did it affect Alice?",The Hatter suggested they all move one place on for clean cups. This resulted in Alice being worse off because the March Hare had just spilled milk into her new spot.,"['“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one place on.”', 'He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.

What rude remark did the Hatter make to Alice?,The Hatter told Alice she shouldn't talk.,"['“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.']"
What happened after Alice left the tea party?,"Alice left the tea party in disgust.

What curious discovery did Alice make about a tree?,"Alice found a tree with a door leading into it and decided to enter, finding it curious but consistent with the day's strange events.",['she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it. “That’s very curious!” she thought. “But everything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.” And in she went.']
How did Alice finally get into the garden?,"Alice returned to the hall, used the golden key to unlock the garden door, and then nibbled her mushroom to shrink to about a foot high, finally entering the beautiful garden.","['Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table. “Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little passage: and then—she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.']"
What were the gardeners doing to the roses?,Alice saw three gardeners painting white roses red on a large rose-tree near the garden entrance.,"['A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red.']"

Don’t go splashing paint over me like that!”', '“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my elbow.”', 'On which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the blame on others!”']"
Why did Five say Seven deserved to be beheaded?,Seven was almost beheaded for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.,"['“Yes, it is his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”']"
Why were the gardeners painting the roses red?,"The gardeners were painting the white roses red because they had mistakenly planted a white rose-tree instead of a red one, and they feared the Queen would have their heads cut off if she found out.","['Two began in a low voice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—”']"
Describe the order and appearance of the procession that arrived.,"The procession included ten club-carrying soldiers, ten diamond-ornamented courtiers, ten heart-ornamented royal children, various Kings and Queens (including the White Rabbit), the Knave of Hearts carrying the King's crown, and finally, the King and Queen of Hearts.","['First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.']"

Live hedgehogs were used as balls, live flamingoes as mallets, and soldiers doubled up to form the arches.","['Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.']"
What challenges did Alice face while playing croquet?,"Alice's main difficulty was managing her flamingo mallet, which would twist its neck and look at her, making her laugh, and the hedgehog balls would unroll and crawl away.","['The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away']"
Describe the general chaos of the croquet game.,"The players played simultaneously, quarreling and fighting for the hedgehogs, while the Queen furiously shouted ""Off with his head!"" or ""Off with her head!"" about once a minute.","['The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a minute.']"
"What appeared in the air during the croquet game, and who did Alice recognize it to be?","Alice saw a grin appearing in the air and recognized it as the Cheshire Cat, feeling glad to have someone to talk to.","['she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.”']"
What were Alice's complaints about the croquet game?,"Alice complained that the game was unfair, chaotic, lacked rules, and was confusing because the living components, like the arches and hedgehogs, moved around.","['“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear oneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the arch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!”']"
What interaction occurred between the King and the Cheshire Cat?,"The King offered the Cat to kiss his hand, but the Cat declined.","['“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.”', '“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.']"

I wish you would have this cat removed!”', 'The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. “Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.']"
"What were the arguments of the executioner, the King, and the Queen regarding the Cheshire Cat's head?",The executioner argued he couldn't cut off a head without a body. The King argued anything with a head could be beheaded. The Queen threatened to execute everyone if nothing was done immediately.,"['The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at his time of life.', 'The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.', 'The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in less than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round.']"

Why did Alice say she couldn't tell her adventures from yesterday?,"Alice said she could tell her adventures from that morning, but not from yesterday, because she was a different person then.","['“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said Alice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.”']"

She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.']"

What was unusual about the handwriting of the verses?,"The verses were not in the prisoner's handwriting, which puzzled the jury until the King suggested he imitated someone else's hand.","['“Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another of the jurymen.', '“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest thing about it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)', '“He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King. (The jury all brightened up again.)']"
What was the King's reasoning for the Knave's guilt based on the unsigned verses?,"The King argued that not signing the verses made the matter worse, implying mischief, as an honest man would sign his name.","['“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter worse. You must have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed your name like an honest man.”']"
What was the Queen's and Alice's differing opinions on the verses proving guilt?,"The Queen claimed it proved guilt, but Alice countered that it proved nothing since they didn't even know what the verses were about.","['“That proves his guilt,” said the Queen.', '“It proves nothing of the sort!” said Alice. “Why, you don’t even know what they’re about!”']"
What instructions did the King give for reading the verses?,"The King instructed the White Rabbit to read the verses from beginning to end, and then stop.","['“Begin at the beginning,” the King said gravely, “and go on till you come to the end: then stop.”']"
What are the contents of the verses read by the White Rabbit?,"The verses are a cryptic poem about someone being told about another's visit, a character reference, an inability to swim, a message about not going, a concern about consequences, a distribution of items (one, two, three or more), items returning, involvement in an affair, trust in setting free, a notion of an obstacle, and a secret about preferences.","['“They told me you had been to her,\n    And mentioned me to him:\nShe gave me a good character,\n    But said I could not swim.\n\nHe sent them word I had not gone\n    (We know it to be true):\nIf she should push the matter on,\n    What would become of you?\n\nI gave her one, they gave him two,\n    You gave us three or more;\nThey all returned from him to you,\n    Though they were mine before.\n\nIf I or she should chance to be\n    Involved in this affair,\nHe trusts to you to set them free,\n    Exactly as we were.\n\nMy notion was that you had been\n    (Before she had this fit)\nAn obstacle that came between\n    Him, and ourselves, and it.\n\nDon’t let him know she liked them best,\n    For this must ever be\nA secret, kept from all the rest,\n    Between yourself and me.”']"
What did Alice offer for an explanation of the verses?,"Alice offered sixpence to anyone who could explain the verses, stating she didn't believe they had any meaning.","['“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of interrupting him,) “I’ll give him sixpence. I don’t believe there’s an atom of meaning in it.”']"
How did the jury react to Alice's comment about the verses' meaning?,"The jury wrote down Alice's statement that she didn't believe there was any meaning in the verses, but none attempted to explain them.","['The jury all wrote down on their slates, “She doesn’t believe there’s an atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the paper.']"
"How did the King interpret the verses, specifically the line about swimming?","The King initially thought no meaning would save trouble, but then found meaning in the line ""said I could not swim,"" asking the Knave if he could swim.","['“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t know,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. “—said I could not swim—” you can’t swim, can you?” he added, turning to the Knave.']"
Could the Knave swim?,"The Knave, being made of cardboard, could not swim.","['The Knave shook his head sadly. “Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he certainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard.)']"
How did the King interpret the lines about giving and returning items?,The King interpreted the lines about giving and returning as referring to the tarts on the table.,"['“I gave her one, they gave him two,\n    You gave us three or more;\nThey all returned from him to you,\n    Though they were mine before.”', '“Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table. “Nothing can be clearer than that.']"
"What pun did the King make, and what was the reaction?","The King made a pun, saying the words didn't ""fit"" the Queen because she never had ""fits,"" which caused silence until he declared it a pun, and then everyone laughed.","['“Then the words don’t fit you,” said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.', '“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed']"
"What was the Queen's unusual demand regarding the trial's procedure, and how did Alice react?","The Queen demanded ""Sentence first—verdict afterwards,"" which Alice loudly declared as ""Stuff and nonsense!""","['“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”', '“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of having the sentence first!”']"
What did Alice say to the Queen and the court when she reached her full size?,"Alice, having grown to her full size, declared the Queen and the others were ""nothing but a pack of cards.""","['“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”']"
What happened immediately after Alice called them a pack of cards?,"The pack of cards flew at Alice, and she found herself waking up on the bank with her head in her sister's lap, her sister brushing leaves from her face.","['At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.']"
"What did Alice tell her sister about, and what was her sister's response?","Alice told her sister about her ""curious dream,"" and her sister confirmed it was curious before telling her to go in for tea.","['“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It was a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.”']"
What did Alice's sister do after Alice left?,"Alice's sister sat watching the setting sun, thinking of Alice's adventures, and then began to dream herself.","['But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:—']"
What elements of Alice's dream did her sister recall in her own dream?,"Alice's sister dreamed of the White Rabbit, the Mouse splashing, the tea party's rattling teacups, the Queen's execution orders, the sneezing pig-baby, crashing dishes, the Gryphon's shriek, the Lizard's pencil squeaking, suppressed guinea-pigs, and the Mock Turtle's sobs.","['The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.']"
What did Alice's sister imagine about Alice's future?,"Alice's sister imagined Alice as a grown woman, retaining her childhood heart, gathering children, and enchanting them with Wonderland tales, sharing their joys and sorrows while remembering her own happy childhood.","['Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.']"

She wished she could shrink like a telescope, believing that after recent events, few things were impossible.","['Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.']"
Why did Alice hesitate before drinking from the bottle?,"Alice decided to check if the bottle was marked 'poison' first, recalling stories of children harmed by not following simple rules, like avoiding poison or hot pokers.","['“No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked ‘poison’ or not”; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.']"
How did Alice feel and what was her size after drinking the liquid?,"Alice felt a curious sensation and realized she was shrinking like a telescope, becoming ten inches high, which delighted her as she could now fit through the garden door.","['“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a telescope.”', 'And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.']"
"How did Alice try to console herself after crying, and what did she recall about her self-discipline?","Alice scolded herself for crying, advising herself to stop. She often gave herself good advice but rarely followed it, even recalling boxing her own ears for cheating herself in croquet, as she enjoyed pretending to be two people.","['“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself, rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.']"
What was Alice's exclamation and observation as she grew larger?,"Alice exclaimed ""Curiouser and curiouser!"" as she grew, feeling like a telescope opening, and her feet seemed to disappear from sight.","['“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!” (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off).']"
What did Alice promise her feet as she grew taller?,"Alice worried about her distant feet, wondering who would put on their shoes and stockings. She decided to be kind to them by promising a new pair of boots every Christmas, fearing they wouldn't walk where she wanted otherwise.","['“Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m sure I shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.”']"
What address did Alice imagine for her right foot?,"Alice imagined the address for her right foot as ""Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender, (with Alice’s love).""","['“Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender, (with Alice’s love).”']"
"How did Alice try to look into the garden after growing, and what was the result?","Alice, now too large, could only lie down and look into the garden with one eye, and feeling hopeless, she began to cry again.","['Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.']"
What was the extent of Alice's second crying fit?,"Alice scolded herself for crying, but continued to shed tears until a large pool, four inches deep and reaching half down the hall, formed around her.","['“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like you,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.']"
"What was Alice's ""great puzzle"" after her second growth spurt?","Alice wondered if she had changed overnight, questioning her identity and finding it a great puzzle.","['“I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that’s the great puzzle!”']"
"What academic subjects did Alice try to recall, and how did she perform?","Alice struggled with multiplication (e.g., 4x5=12) and geography (e.g., London is the capital of Paris), concluding she must have been changed for Mabel due to her incorrect knowledge.","['“Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome—no, that’s all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel!']"
How did Alice's attempt to recite a poem go?,"Alice tried to recite ""How doth the little—"" but her voice was hoarse and strange, and the words came out differently than she remembered.","['“I’ll try and say ‘How doth the little—’” and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:—']"
What was Alice's resolution if she was indeed Mabel?,"Alice concluded she must be Mabel, fearing a life with no toys and many lessons. She decided to stay down there until she knew who she was, wishing someone would come down to her.","['“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve made up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’ I shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down here till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, “I do wish they would put their heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!”']"
What did Alice notice about her hands that indicated another change in size?,Alice noticed she had put on one of the Rabbit's white kid gloves and realized she was shrinking again.,"['As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while she was talking. “How can I have done that?” she thought. “I must be growing small again.”']"
"What new problem did Alice face after shrinking again, and how did she feel about it?","Alice, now very small, found the garden door shut and the golden key on the table, unreachable. She felt things were worse than ever, being smaller than before.","['“That was a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and now for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than ever,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”']"
"What happened to Alice after she complained about her size, and what was her initial thought?","Alice slipped and fell chin-deep into salt water. She initially thought she was in the sea and could return by railway, recalling her previous seaside experience.","['As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by railway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.)']"
What was Alice's reflection on her tears while swimming?,"Alice regretted crying so much, fearing she would drown in her own tears, and noted that everything was queer that day.","['“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That will be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.”']"
"How did Alice decide to address the Mouse, and why?","Alice wondered if the mouse could talk and decided to ask it for directions out of the pool, using a Latin grammar declension as a guide for addressing it.","['“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she began: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”)']"
What was Alice's theory about the Mouse's origin and language?,"Alice thought the Mouse might be French, having come with William the Conqueror, though her historical understanding was vague.","['“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)']"
Why did Alice apologize to the Mouse?,"Alice apologized to the Mouse, realizing she had offended it by mentioning cats.","['“Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like cats.”']"
How did the Mouse express its hatred for cats?,"The Mouse, trembling, declared its family always hated cats, calling them ""nasty, low, vulgar things,"" and demanded never to hear the name again.","['“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. “As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name again!”']"
What promise did Alice make to the Mouse to get it to return?,"Alice called the Mouse back, promising not to talk about cats or dogs. The Mouse returned, pale with passion, and agreed to tell its history on shore to explain its hatred.","['“Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”']"
Describe the appearance of the party assembled on the bank.,"The party on the bank was queer-looking, with birds having draggled feathers and animals with clinging fur, all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.","['They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.']"
What was the argument between Alice and the Lory about?,"Alice argued with the Lory, who claimed superior knowledge due to age but refused to disclose its age, ending the discussion.","['Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am older than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.']"
Why was Alice anxious about getting dry?,"Alice anxiously watched the Mouse, fearing she would catch a bad cold if she didn't dry soon.","['Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.']"
How did the Lory interrupt the Mouse's history lesson?,"The Lory shivered and said ""Ugh!"" during the Mouse's history, but then denied speaking when questioned by the Mouse.","['“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.', '“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did you speak?”', '“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.']"
What was the Duck's humorous interjection during the Mouse's story?,"The Duck interrupted the Mouse, asking ""Found what?"" and then humorously suggested ""it"" usually meant a frog or worm when she found something, pressing for what the archbishop found.","['“Found what?” said the Duck.', '“Found it,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know what ‘it’ means.”', '“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when I find a thing,” said the Duck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?”']"
What was the Eaglet's complaint about the Dodo's speech?,"The Eaglet demanded the Dodo speak English, claiming it didn't understand half the long words and doubted the Dodo did either.","['“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!”']"
"Who was designated to give out the prizes, and what was the reaction?","The Dodo pointed to Alice, declaring she would give the prizes, causing the party to crowd around her demanding them.","['“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.', '“Why, she, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”']"
How did Alice react to receiving the thimble prize?,"Alice found the thimble prize absurd but accepted it solemnly, not daring to laugh due to the others' grave expressions.","['Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.']"
What happened when the comfits were eaten?,"Eating the comfits caused noise and confusion, with large birds complaining about taste and small ones choking.","['The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.']"
"What was Alice's misunderstanding about the Mouse's ""tale""?","Alice was confused by the Mouse calling its story a ""sad tale,"" thinking it referred to its long tail, and she continued to puzzle over it during the narration.","['“It is a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:—']"
What misunderstanding led to the Mouse walking away from Alice?,"Alice offered to help undo a ""knot,"" mistaking the Mouse's ""not!"" for a literal knot, which offended the Mouse, causing it to walk away.","['“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”', '“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”']"
"What advice did the old Crab give her daughter, and how did the daughter respond?","The Lory sighed about the Mouse leaving, and an old Crab advised her daughter not to lose her temper, to which the young Crab snappishly replied, ""Hold your tongue, Ma! You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!""","['“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little snappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”']"
"Why did Alice regret mentioning Dinah, and what was the result?","Alice regretted mentioning Dinah, feeling lonely and low-spirited, and began to cry again, wondering if she'd ever see Dinah again.","['“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy tone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.']"
What had vanished from the hall since Alice's swim in the pool?,"Alice searched for the fan and gloves, but they were gone, along with the great hall, glass table, and little door, which seemed to have vanished since her swim.","['Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.']"
What was Alice's realization about the Rabbit's mistake?,Alice realized the Rabbit mistook her for his housemaid and decided to find his fan and gloves.,"['“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.”']"
What did Alice imagine about Dinah sending her on messages?,"Alice found it queer to run errands for a rabbit and imagined Dinah sending her on messages, but then thought Dinah wouldn't be allowed to order people about.","['“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute, nurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I don’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!”']"
Why did Alice drink from the unlabeled bottle?,"Alice drank from an unlabeled bottle, expecting something interesting to happen, hoping it would make her grow large again.","['There was no label this time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. “I know something interesting is sure to happen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so I’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”']"
What were Alice's reflections on her current situation compared to home and fairy-tales?,"Alice longed for home, where she wasn't constantly changing size or being ordered by animals. She felt she was living a fairy-tale and should have a book written about her, but realized she was already ""grown up"" in her current confined state.","['“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what can have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a sorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more here.”']"
What were Alice's mixed feelings about not growing older?,"Alice considered the comfort of never growing old, but disliked the idea of always having lessons to learn.","['“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I never get any older than I am now? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like that!”']"
Why did Alice conclude she couldn't learn lessons in her current state?,"Alice scolded herself, realizing there was no room for her or lesson-books to learn lessons in her current confined state.","['“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn lessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for you, and no room at all for any lesson-books!”']"
What was ironic about Alice's fear of the Rabbit?,"Alice trembled with fear, shaking the house, despite being a thousand times larger than the approaching Rabbit, forgetting her size advantage.","['Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.']"
What did Pat identify in the window?,"The Rabbit asked Pat what was in the window, and Pat replied it was an ""arrum"" (arm).","['“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”', '“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)']"
What was the Rabbit's command regarding the arm in the window?,"Pat insisted it was an arm despite its size, and the Rabbit ordered him to remove it.","['“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”', '“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”']"
What was the result of Alice's second snatch out the window?,"Alice heard whispers and then caused two shrieks and more broken glass by snatching again, leading her to wonder about the number of cucumber-frames and wishing they could pull her out.","['There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were two little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what they’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they could! I’m sure I don’t want to stay in here any longer!”']"
What did Alice hear outside the house after the broken glass incident?,"Alice heard cartwheels and voices discussing ladders, ropes, and the roof, culminating in Bill being ordered to go down the chimney after a crash.","['She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other ladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill! fetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do well enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down! Heads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I fancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, I shan’t! You do it!—That I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says you’re to go down the chimney!”']"
What was Alice's thought process upon hearing Bill was coming down the chimney?,Alice noted that Bill was always given difficult tasks and decided to kick him as he came down the narrow chimney.,"['“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to herself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I think I can kick a little!”']"
What sounds followed Alice's kick in the chimney?,"After Alice kicked, she heard shouts of ""There goes Bill!"" and ""Catch him!"", followed by voices offering brandy and asking Bill what happened.","['The first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!” then the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then silence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy now—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about it!”']"
"What did the Rabbit suggest bringing, and what was it?","The Rabbit suggested a barrowful of pebbles, which then came rattling through the window, hitting Alice.","['“A barrowful will do, to begin with.”', '“A barrowful of what?” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.']"
How did Alice react to the pebbles hitting her?,"Alice shouted ""You'd better not do that again!"" to stop the pebbles, causing silence.","['“I’ll put a stop to this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that again!” which produced another dead silence.']"
What was Alice's main concern after escaping the puppy?,"Alice, resting against a buttercup, wished she was the right size to teach the puppy tricks and realized she needed to find something to eat or drink to grow back to her normal size.","['“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how is it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?”']"
