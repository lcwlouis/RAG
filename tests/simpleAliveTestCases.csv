What happened to the baby the Duchess was nursing?,The baby turned into a pig.,"['There could be no doubt that it had\na _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\nits eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\nnot like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was only\nsobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\nwere any tears.\n\nNo, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,”\nsaid Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\nnow!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\nto say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\n\nAlice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do\nwith this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so\nviolently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm.

How did the Cheshire Cat vanish?,"The Cheshire Cat vanished slowly, starting with its tail and ending with its grin, which lingered after the rest of its body was gone.","['“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\nbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\nremained some time after the rest of it had gone.']"

Why is it always tea-time for the Hatter and his friends?,"It's always tea-time because the Hatter and Time had a quarrel, and now Time won't do anything the Hatter asks, so it's perpetually six o'clock.","['“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’t\ndo a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.”\n\nA bright idea came into Alice’s head. “Is that the reason so many\ntea-things are put out here?” she asked.\n\n“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time,\nand we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”']"
